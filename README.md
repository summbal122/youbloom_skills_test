# Youbloom Skills Test  

I created this project same as it is mentioned in the document, the instructions of project.  
The focus was on **clean code** and **responsive design**.  
I used **React**, **React DOM**, **Redux Toolkit**, **React Redux**, **React Router DOM**, **React Icons**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Parcel** and **Local Storage** for the core app.  
For testing and build setup, I used **Jest**, **React Testing Library**, and **Babel**.
